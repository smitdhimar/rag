It is part of the Apple silicon series, as a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) for its Mac desktops and notebooks, and the iPad Pro and iPad Air tablets.[4] The M1 chip initiated Apple's third change to the instruction set architecture used by Macintosh computers, switching from Intel to Apple silicon fourteen years after they were switched from PowerPC to Intel, and twenty-six years after the transition from the original Motorola 68000 series to PowerPC. At the time of its introduction in 2020, Apple said that the M1 had \"the world's fastest CPU core in low power silicon\" and the world's best CPU performance per watt.[4][5] Its successor, Apple M2, was announced on June 6, 2022, at Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).\n",
    "\n",
    "The original M1 chip was introduced in November 2020, and was followed by the professional-focused M1 Pro and M1 Max chips in October 2021. The M1 Max is a higher-powered version of the M1 Pro, with more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, a larger die size, and a large used interconnect. Apple introduced the M1 Ultra in 2022, a desktop workstation chip containing two interconnected M1 Max units. These chips differ largely in size and the number of functional units: for example, while the original M1 has about 16 billion transistors, the M1 Ultra has 114 billion.\n",

He was proactive in learning new tools, asked the right questions, \\nand consistently delivered his tasks responsibly. His enthusiasm for problem-solving and his \\nwillingness to collaborate effectively made him a valuable part of the team. \\nI am confident that Smit will continue to grow and excel in his future roles.
