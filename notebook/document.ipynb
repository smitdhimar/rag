At the time of its introduction in 2020, Apple said that the M1 had \"the world's fastest CPU core in low power silicon\" and the world's best CPU performance per watt.[4][5] Its successor, Apple M2, was announced on June 6, 2022, at Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).\n",

Apple introduced the M1 Ultra in 2022, a desktop workstation chip containing two interconnected M1 Max units.
